# Pole-Dash

# Overview

I love online video games. I grew up on The Legend of Zelda: Occarina of Time on Nintendo 64, grew into The Elder Scrolls, and always enjoyed a few rounds of Call of Duty. My love translated into a love for programming, specifically creating solutions to problems and implementing inventive ideas. Though my initial idea of this project was much larger, I had not anticipated the requirements Unreal Engine would need from my system, so this very simple game is my first creation. I attribute all of my work to the help of Unreal Sensei. Their tutorials were and are invaluable. Thank you!

This game is simple: your goal is to reach the golden statue. If you do, you'll be declared the winner. However, you must avoid 5 spinning poles guarding the way, each spinning at a different rate and in different directions. If you hit the pole, your character will "die" (go limp), a game ending sound will play, and you'll have to start over.

# Development Environment

This project was created with blueprints and assets provided by Unreal Engine and their creators. Every asset you see is free and available to use. 

This program was focused on the use of precise blueprints in Unreal Engine. A blueprint is a simple version of C++ code that allows the creator more time and capabilities in creating amazing gameplay. It also drastically reduces the experience and time required from a programmer.
